	<p> tester.js contains 2 parts: Tester for static abilities and tester for dynamic abilities. Each part contains 10 tests.</p>
	<h2> Static tester - examins the following things:  </h2>
    <p>1) Sending a legal request - Checks that the server deals with a legal http request.  </p>
    <p>2) Unexisting file Request - Checks that the server returns "404 Not Found" status when the 
      request is for a file that doesn't exists in the directory.  </p>
    <p>3) Too many arguments in the request initial line - Checks that the server doesn't accept 
      requests that contains more than the 3 arguments in the conventional http protocol.  </p>
    <p>4) Too little arguments in the request initial line - Checks that the server doesn't accept 
      requests that contains less than the 3 arguments in the conventional http protocol.  </p>
    <p>5) Illegal HTTP version - Checks that the server doesn't accept requests from an illegal http 
      version.  </p>
    <p>6) Illegal HTTP version parameter - Checks that the server doesn't support http requests that 
      has an illegal parameter at the http version.
    <p>7) Not a GET method - Checks that the server doesn't support http requests that are not GET 
      requests.  </p>
    <p>8) Illegal method parameter - Checks that the server doesn't support http requests that has an 
      illegal method parameter.  </p>
    <p>9) Ignore multiple spaces - Checks that the server deals with multiple spaces, that those
      spaces don't harm the parsing of the request. A legal request will be responded correctly.  </p>
    <p>10) Send multiple requests at once - Checks that the server deals with input data that contains 
      several http requests.</p>
